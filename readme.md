# Microservices Application

The Microservices Application is a distributed system composed of multiple independent services that work together to fulfill various functionalities. Each service focuses on a specific domain or feature, and they communicate with each other through well-defined APIs. This README provides an overview of the architecture, setup instructions, and usage guidelines for the entire application.

## Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture, which consists of the following components:

1. **API Gateway:** Acts as a single entry point for client requests and routes them to the appropriate backend services.
2. **User Service:** Manages user-related operations such as registration, authentication, and profile management.
3. **Material Service:** Handles operations related to materials, such as creation, retrieval, and deletion.
4. **Transaction Service:** Manages transactions between users and materials, including buying, selling, and viewing transaction history.
5. **Database:** Stores data for each service. Each service may have its own database or share a common database, depending on the requirements.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)
- MySQL (for backend services)
- Postman (for testing APIs)
